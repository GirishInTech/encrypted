## Automated Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Clear Names**: Use descriptive test method names
3. **Setup/Teardown**: Use setUp() and tearDown() methods
4. **Assertions**: Use appropriate assertion methods
5. **Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ code coverage
6. **Speed**: Keep tests fast
7. **Documentation**: Comment complex test logic

## Continuous Testing
